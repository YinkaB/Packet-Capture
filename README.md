# Packet-Capture
Objective :
The Packet Capture Lab project aimed to create a controlled environment for monitoring, capturing, and analyzing network traffic to identify potential cyber threats and malicious behavior. The primary focus was to use tools like Wireshark to inspect packet-level data in real time, helping visualize how data moves across the network and how attackers may exploit weaknesses.

Skills Learned :
Captured and analyzed live network traffic using Wireshark and tcpdump
Interpreted common network protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP)
Applied Wireshark display filters to isolate suspicious activity
Identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as:
Port scans
Brute force attempts
ARP spoofing
Followed TCP streams to analyze full conversations and session data
Used protocol decoders and IO graphs for traffic visualization
Differentiated between normal and abnormal network behavior

Tools Used
Wireshark – for real-time packet capturing and deep packet inspection
tcpdump – for command-line packet capture (optional)
VirtualBox/VMware – to simulate a networked lab environment
Kali Linux – for generating test traffic (e.g., Nmap scans, brute force attacks)
Windows/Linux endpoints – as traffic sources and targets
